### Why creating schedules can give us headaches:

- A typical weekly employee shedule for a retail shop open from 8:30 AM to 22:30 PM with nine employees has:

> 2 possible states for a half hour time unit (assigned or not)... **to the power of**... 9 employees * 7 days per week * 14 hours per day * 2 in half hours

...which means 1,039710311×10⁵³¹ possible solutions. This is a lot more than the minimal number of atoms in the known universe (1×10⁸⁰).

It is impossible to evaluate every possible solution even if we compute with the fastest machine for billion of years. This in why *creating schedules can give us headaches* and why traditional planners do not even try to **really** automatically make a schedule.

- Ask yourself this: can I accept an employee's request to switch from full time to half time? Will it still be possible to create a schedule that is compatible with regulation constraints?

No traditional planner can answer this question, no spreadsheet, in fact no one can. Auto Shift Planner will try to give you a possible solution if it exists.
